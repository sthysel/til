[1]  - As with other commands in vi, you can playback a macro any number of times.
     The following command would playback the macro assigned to the key `w' 100
     times: 100@w

[2] - Vim uses words that exist in your current buffer and any other buffer you 
     may have open for auto-complete suggestions.
